### 🔭 Current Projects

| Repository | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| [**John The Ripper Craking Passwords Analisys**](https://github.com/aitanax/jtr_cracking_passw_analisys) | 🔐 In this project, we focus on password cracking using John the Ripper. The repository showcases our analysis of results, exploring different attack modes and strategies to efficiently crack hashed passwords. The goal is to demonstrate how John the Ripper can be used for security testing and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of password encryption. |
| [**Movility Heuristic Problem Solved**](https://github.com/aitanax/Proyecto_Movilidad) | 🧠 In this project, we tackled a complex heuristic problem related to optimizing ambulance deployment across a geographical area. The challenge was to strategically place a limited number of ambulances to maximize coverage and minimize response time to emergencies, all while adhering to various constraints such as resource limitations and population density. |
| [**Type of Stars Clustering**](https://github.com/aitanax/Clustering_Estrellas) | 🌟  In this project, we applied clustering techniques to categorize stars based on their properties. While some clusters matched known star types like red and brown dwarfs, others revealed atypical or distinctive characteristics, suggesting the need for further investigation. |
| [**A Star Algorithm**](https://github.com/aitanax/Algoritmo_A) |  🖥️  . |
